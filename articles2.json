    "SOFIA (Reuters) - A Bulgarian court on Thursday sentenced three Syrians to six years in jail on terrorism charges. The Speciliased Criminal Court convicted the three men for entering the Balkan country aiming to carry out terrorist actions abroad, but acquitted them from charges of being members of Islamic State and Muslim Brotherhood. The three men, aged 20, 22 and 25, were arrested last February while trying to enter Turkey from Bulgaria and accused of attempting to join Islamic State in Syria. They have been in custody since then. The three men, who had obtained refugee status in Germany, denied any wrongdoing. Their lawyers said they will appeal the sentence.",
    "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s intelligence minister said U.S. President Donald Trump’s speech against the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran on Friday was 'very significant' and could lead to war given threats that preceded it from Tehran. Israel’s Channel 2 TV asked Intelligence Minister Israel Katz whether he saw a risk of war after Trump’s speech. 'Absolutely, yes. I think that the speech was very significant,' Katz responded. 'Iran is the new North Korea. We see where things are goings.'",
    "One of the most controversial figures in the upcoming Trump administration (and this is out of a circus freak show of racist white men and corporate oligarchs) is General Michael T. Flynn, who s been slated to serve as Trump s national security adviser. Flynn, it seems, shared classified information.Flynn, like Donald Trump, seems to have an itchy trigger finger when it comes to computers. Last month, Flynn retweeted a fake news link that accused Hillary Clinton of engaging money laundering and sex crimes out of a D.C. pizza joint. Of course, this later became known as  Pizzagate,  and even prompted an armed gunman to storm the pizza place, but it s a Trump world now, so that s all normal, right?Image via Wayback MachineJust four years ago, Flynn presented his staff with a  how to dress for success  presentation that advised both men and women how to dress. It s as bad as you d imagine. While he encourages men to dress to exhibit  authority,  the women have much different criteria. Women are to dress to look attractive, but not too attractive. Not gaudy but not plain. Women need to wear makeup, but not too much makeup. They should  accentuate the positive/disguise the negative. The most serious of Flynn s foibles, though, is a revelation that he shared classified information with foreign military officers in Afghanistan. The investigation took place in 2010, and it was determined that while he did  inappropriately share  classified information,  there was no actual or potential damage to national security.  We don t have the details, because, well, they were classified, but for a national security adviser, this is more than troubling.Hillary Clinton was defeated in part because Trump and Republicans made an email scandal that wasn t into a national security issue. Trump, amidst cries of  drain the swamp,  intermingled with  lock her up,  promised a scandal-free presidency. Instead, we are getting far worse than more of the same. Flynn should be disqualified, today.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images.",

    "GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea is ready to send  more gift packages  to the United States, one of its top diplomats said on Tuesday, dismissing the international uproar over his country s latest and biggest nuclear weapons test. Han Tae Song, ambassador of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the United Nations in Geneva, was addressing the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament two days after his country detonated its sixth nuclear test explosion.   I am proud of saying that just two days ago on the third of September, DPRK successfully carried out a hydrogen bomb test for intercontinental ballistic rocket under its plan for building a strategic nuclear force,  Han told the Geneva forum.  The recent self-defense measures by my country, DPRK, are a  gift package  addressed to none other than the U.S.,  Han said.  The U.S. will receive more  gift packages  from my country as long as its relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on the DPRK,  he added without elaborating. U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood sought to turn the tables on Han by using his language against him.  With regard to the so-called gift packages that the North is presenting, my recommendation to the North would be, instead of spending inordinate amounts of money on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, that it give its people the gift package of peace with their neighbors, economic development and an opportunity to rejoin the family of nations.  Han said military measures being taken by North Korea were  an exercise of restraint and justified self-defense right  to counter  the ever-growing and decade-long U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy aimed at isolating my country.  Pressure or sanctions will never work on my country,  Han declared, adding:  The DPRK will never under any circumstances put its nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table.  Wood said that North Korea had defied the international community once again with its test.   We look forward to working with our partners in the (U.N. Security) Council with regard to a new resolution that will put some of the strongest sanctions possible on the DPRK,  he told the conference.  Advances in the regime s nuclear and missile program are a threat to us all ... now is the time to say tests, threats and destabilizing actions will no longer be tolerated,  Wood said.  It can no longer be business as usual with this regime.   The White House said on Monday President Donald Trump had agreed  in principle  to scrap a warhead weight limit on South Korea s missiles following the North s latest test.     The United States accused North Korea s trading partners of aiding its nuclear ambitions and said Pyongyang was  begging for war . ",

    "LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland and Wales proposed changes on Wednesday to the central UK government s Brexit bill in an attempt to bed down their current powers which they fear could be weakened after Brexit. Scotland s Brexit minister Michael Russell said verbal assurances from London that Edinburgh and Cardiff would keep all their powers after Britain leaves the European Union were not sufficient due to distrust toward the central government.  There needs to be an injection of trust into the negotiating process,  Russell told Scottish lawmakers during a parliamentary committee session in Edinburgh. The EU issue has pulled the United Kingdom s four parts in different directions because England and Wales voted for Brexit while Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the bloc. The Scottish government, run by the pro-independence Scottish National Party, and its Welsh counterpart, run by Labour, have both accused the Conservative central government of failing to give them a meaningful role in the Brexit process. The EU withdrawal bill, which is currently going through the UK parliament in London, is designed to convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones. It is part of Britain s plan to provide legal clarity before it parts ways with the EU. But the bill has raised hackles in Edinburgh and Cardiff, which currently control policy areas such as health, education, transport and agriculture, because it does not make clear what the status of those devolved powers will be after Brexit. The UK government says that Scotland and Wales will be returned their devolved powers in a second phase, but that has failed to quell anxieties.  We are willing to cooperate with the UK government but this cannot mean allowing (Britain s national parliament) to drive a coach and horses through the devolution settlement,  said Russell in a separate statement.     Under Britain s constitution, the UK parliament must seek consent from the Scottish and Welsh assemblies when legislating on policy areas that overlap into their domestic powers. While they do not have veto powers over the Brexit bill, ignoring their wishes would mark a new low in already tetchy relations between London, Edinburgh and Cardiff. That could give an incentive to the UK government to incorporate at least some of the Scottish and Welsh amendments to avoid the embarrassment of a constitutional clash. Stephen Crabb, a Conservative member of parliament and former minister for Wales, told Reuters he thought there should be some room for maneuver.  UK government ministers probably have to say a bit more and to give a bit more to try to bridge the gulf at the moment,  he said in an interview. ",
    "CHESTER TOWNSHIP, Pa. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would work with U.S. lawmakers if elected to tie federal funding and tax breaks for colleges and universities to a 'good faith' commitment by them to lower tuition costs for students. 'If universities want access to all of these federal tax breaks and tax dollars paid for by you,' Trump told a rally in a Philadelphia suburb, 'they have to make good faith efforts to reduce the cost of college.' Trump did not offer specifics on how he would tie federal funding to changes in college tuition.  His Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has proposed making in-state tuition for colleges and universities free immediately for families earning $85,000 or less, and free by 2021 for families making up to $125,000 a year.  Trump, a New York businessman, has not said much about the cost of college while campaigning. But U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who competed against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, made government-funded college tuition central to his campaign platform.  Sanders drew a great deal of support from the youngest group of American voters, and Trump, who needs to win over more women and young people before the Nov. 8 election, took up a similar theme in his proposal. U.S. student debt has surged about 24 percent to around $1.2 trillion since 2012, according to figures earlier this year from the New York Federal Reserve, leaving many graduates with mortgage-sized tabs before they enter the workforce.",
    "It s all about the money isn t that the way it is with these RINO politicians who ve sold out the American people to big business? Well, John McCain is no different and should be taken to the woodshed one final time for his role in repeatedly destroying any hope we have of getting rid of Obamacare.BEWARE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has paid millions to the GOP to keep Obamacare on behalf of multinational corporations who exploit and erode the U.S. economy. The largest beneficiaries of those payments has long been the RINOS within the senate. McCain s position is not a surprise. INSURERS PROFIT FROM OBAMACARE NO VOTE:Shares of U.S. insurers gained after news that McCain would not support the bill. Insurers had fallen over the past week as investors worried about spending cuts.Centene Corp gained 1.6 percent to $92.22 while Molina Healthcare rose 4.5 percent to $65.32. Both specialize in government-funded healthcare.The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists oppose the bill.WASHINGTON (Reuters)   U.S. Senator John McCain said on Friday he opposes the latest Republican bill to dismantle Obamacare, dealing the measure what could be a fatal blow given the party s slim Senate majority.With several other Republicans still undecided on the measure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this week he intended to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote next week, though he did not promise to do so.A vote would set the stage for another dramatic Capitol Hill decision on the 2010 law that brought health insurance to millions of Americans and became former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature domestic achievement.Read more: Reuters"
