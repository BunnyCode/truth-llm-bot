    "Published July 27 2016 SEND httpsabahdai.ly912r3U DHA Photo A twin bombing struck a crowd in a predominantly Kurdish town in northern Syria on Wednesday killing 44 people and wounding dozens more Syrias state-run news agency and Kurdish media reported. The Daesh group claimed responsibility for the attack. Media reports said a truck loaded with large quantities of explosives blew up on the western edge of the town of Qamishli followed by an explosives-packed motorcycle a few minutes later in the same area. The blasts caused massive damage in the area and rescue teams were working to recover victims from under the rubble the SANA news agency said. This photo captured from the town of Nusaybin near the Turkish side of the border shows plume of smoke occurred after the explosion. (IHA Photo) Qamishli near the Turkish border is mainly controlled by PYD but Syrian regime forces are present and control the towns airport. Syrian television broadcast footage showing people running away from a mushroom of gray smoke rising over the town and others running amid wrecked or burnt cars. Qamishli resident Suleiman Youssef a writer told The Associated Press by telephone that he heard the first explosion from few miles away. He said the blasts leveled several buildings to the ground and many people were trapped under the rubble. 'Most of the buildings at the scene of the explosion have been heavily damaged because of the strength of the blast' he said. The Daesh group in a statement published by its affiliated Aamaq news agency said it carried out the attack in Qamishli describing it as a truck bombing that struck a complex of Kurdish offices. The terrorist group has carried out several bombings in Kurdish areas in Syria in the past. The PYD-dominated and U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces have been the main force fighting Daesh in northern Syria capturing significant territory from the terrorists over the past two years. Wednesdays explosion came as U.S.-backed Kurdish forces pressed ahead with their offensive to take the Daesh-held town of Manbij also in northern Syria but further to the west of Qamishli.",
    "Published August 15 2016 SEND httpsabahdai.lyBbrl4U People inspect a damaged building in Idlib after warplanes pounded the city yesterday. Syrian warplanes bombed opposition-held Idlib province killing at least 22 people. Clashes in Aleppo have also intensified and bombs dropped by the regime killed at least 49 people over the weekend Syrias opposition-held northwestern Idlib province came under heavy bombardment Sunday activists reported as opposition fighters and pro-government forces battled for control of the nearby city of Aleppo. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 26 airstrikes across the province one of the last remaining bastions of opposition control. 22 people were killed during the airstrikes. Opposition groups in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million are mounting an offensive to seize contested Aleppo. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo province have found refuge in Idlib. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. The strikes killed a large number of militants while destroying two command posts six arms caches two tanks four armored infantry vehicles and seven all-terrain vehicles with heavy machine guns the Defense Ministry statement said. The ministry made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Elsewhere in Syria opposition groups and government forces battled around a major power plant in the central Hama province. State media reported that opposition fighters inflicted heavy damage to the Zaara generating station while an opposition media activist in the nearby town of Aqrab said the power plant was not targeted. Obeida al-Hamawi of the activist-run Hama Media Center said government forces had launched an assault from positions near the plant to retake the village of Zaara captured by opposition groups earlier this year. He said electricity was still being supplied to the area. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the area. Clashes and airstrikes meanwhile continued across the northern Aleppo province resulting in at least 49 civilian deaths on Saturday alone activists and state media reported. Five children were among the dead. The Observatory said government airstrikes and shelling on opposition areas in Aleppo city and the surrounding countryside killed 40 civilians Saturday while the Local Coordination Committees put the toll in opposition areas at 45 dead. State media and the Observatory said opposition shelling on government-held districts of Aleppo city killed nine civilians including two children. State media said another 22 people were wounded. Fighting for the city has intensified this summer after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into opposition-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege opposition forces took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighborhoods.",
    "Published April 4 2017 The Assad regime has used chemical weapons once again killing at least 100 civilians including children in an airstrike that released on the opposition-held Idlib. Thirty ambulances were dispatched from Turkey to rescue those in dire need of help. The Assad regime continues to commit crimes against humanity as more than 100 civilians were killed and 500 others mostly children have been affected by the chlorine gas attack carried out by regime warplanes in the Khan Shaykun town in Idlib. The latest chemical attack was seen as the worst in the countys six-year war. With many civilians suffering respiratory problems in dire need of help Turkey dispatched 30 fully equipped ambulances for rescue operations. The reports claim that it was the third chemical attack in over a week in Syria as the Assad regime consistently targets residential areas. The first two attacks were reported in Hama province an area close to yesterdays chemical attack. After the gas attack the Syrian regime reportedly bombarded a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims. Turkey condemned the chemical attack on Syrias opposition-held town of Idlib describing it as 'a crime against humanity.' The chemical attacks on Idlib were 'inhuman' and 'unacceptable' President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said while stressing the importance of maintaining the fragile Syrian cease-fire. In a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin the president reiterated the need for further efforts to strengthen cooperation in the fight against terrorism. Foreign Minister Mevlt avuïÅolu also stated that the suspected use of chemical weapons could derail the process of Syrian peace talks being held in Astana Kazakhstan. The parallel series of talks in Astana Kazakhstan aim to bolster the truce to support the U.N. negotiations. Damascus has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days with the moderate Syrian opposition making large incursions into the east of the Syrian capital while the Assad regime has responded with airstrikes on opposition positions. The last round of Astana talks began on Feb. 23 and ended on March 4 without any clear result. The next meetings in Astana are to be held on May 3-4. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was 'seriously concerned' by reports of a suspected gas attack. 'The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is seriously concerned about the alleged chemical weapons attack reported by the media this morning in the Khan Sheikhun area of southern Idlib' the group said adding it was 'gathering and analyzing information from all available sources.' Chlorine gas is one of several elements and compounds used in devastating chemical attacks outlawed by international treaties. A high level of exposure to the gas can cause suffocation as the chemical injures the pulmonary airways resulting in severe fluid buildup in the lungs with children and seniors particularly vulnerable. In the wake of the 2013 attack Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal and joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. His government declared a 1300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons amid international outrage at a nerve gas attack on the outskirts of Damascus. Those weapons have been destroyed but member states of the OPCW have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything in 2013. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then. The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead. Frances foreign minister called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a 'disgusting' gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. 'In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council' he added. France Britain and the United States in February put forward a resolution to impose sanctions targeting Syrian government officials over accusations of chemical weapon attacks during the six-year conflict. The international inquiry found Syrian regime was responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Daesh militants had used mustard gas.",
    "Published April 2 2017 Syrian opposition forces on Sunday claimed that Russian jets in violation of a cease-fire hit an outpost in northwestern Syrias Idlib province near the border with Turkey killing at least one opposition fighter and wounding several others. They said several overnight raids hit Babeska a village in Idlib that has become a haven for several moderate Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups. A tripartite mechanism was established in February by Turkey Russia and Iran to monitor the ceasefire in Syria. Opposition forces however say Russia has failed to pressure the Assad regime to ensure the ceasefire holds. The village also houses hundreds of families and fighters from the Damascus suburb of Daraya which fell to Assad regime forces last year and was evacuated by opposition forces.

    "Published February 23 2015 A suicide bomber killed four people in a hospital on Sunday in an attack that took Syrias civil war to the ruling Assad clans hometown for the first time a monitoring group said. The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. 'The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person' said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. 'Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack' said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 took place in the parking of Qardaha hospital. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province where the town is located has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent.",
    "Published July 5 2015 U.S.-led coalition aircraft unleashed a series of airstrikes targeting the self proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) groups stronghold of Raqqa in eastern Syria in what the coalition said Sunday was one of its most sustained aerial operations carried out in Syria to date. ISIS said at least 10 people were killed and many others wounded. At least 16 airstrikes were reported late Saturday and early Sunday triggering successive explosions that shook the city and created panic among residents activists said. The U.S.-led coalition often targets ISIS-held towns and cities in Syria but the overnight strikes on Raqqa were rare in their intensity. In a statement issued early Sunday the coalition said it had conducted 16 airstrikes throughout Raqqa destroying vital ISIS-controlled structures and transit routes in Syria. 'The significant airstrikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq' said coalition spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Gilleran using the Arabic acronym for the ISIS group. 'This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move' from Raqqa he said. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the so-called caliphate declared a year ago by the ISIS terror group in territories it controls in Iraq and Syria. The sustained airstrikes add pressure on the militants in Raqqa still reeling from last months loss of the border town of Tal Abyad to Kurdish fighters. The town on the Turkish border was a major avenue for commerce and smuggling for the group. A militant website said 10 people were killed and dozens of others wounded. An ISIS-affiliated Facebook page said one civilian was among those killed and 10 were wounded including women and children. It also said the bombing destroyed several bridges. The ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency released a video of what it said was the effects of shelling Saturday by a U.S. drone on Raqqa. It showed several wounded men on a stretcher and at least three young boys being treated for wounds at what appeared to be a hospital. A Raqqa-based anti-ISIS activist network reported eight civilians were killed by the coalition airstrikes including a 10-year-old child. The casualty figures could not be independently confirmed. The network called Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered said at least one airstrike targeted a group of ISIS members in the city center. Another targeted an ISIS checkpoint while a third destroyed large parts of an ISIS-held brick factory in the city. In the remote northeastern city of Hassakeh ISIS suicide bombers detonated an explosives-laden truck near a main power plant Sunday. State-run news agency SANA reported casualties and damage in the plant on the southern edge of the city. Fighting has raged in Hassakeh since the ISIS group attacked several southern neighborhoods held by government troops earlier this month. The violence has forced tens of thousands of residents to flee. The predominantly Kurdish city was split between government forces and Kurdish fighters who have been fighting the ISIS group separately. In Iraq a Defense Ministry statement said government forces repelled an ISIS attack Sunday morning on the town of Haditha and the nearby Haditha dam in Anbar province. At least 20 militants were killed in the failed attack said the statement which did not provide any further information. Iraqi forces backed by Shiite militias have been struggling to recapture areas lost to the ISIS group in the countrys west and north. In May the militant group scored a stunning victory overrunning Ramadi the provincial capital of western Anbar province. Yet Haditha and some other towns remain under control of government forces and allied Sunni tribal fighters. In Lebanon some 200 Kurdish nationals staged a demonstration in downtown Beirut in solidarity with their brethren in Syria who are fighting against ISIS militants.",
    "Published July 20 2015 A checkpoint that belonged to Assads forces is seen after a coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh said they took control of it on a highway that connects Aleppo to Latakia June 6 2015 (Reuters) Two people were killed and 15 injured as Syrian regime forces attacked the Avanl village of the Jabal al-Turkmen Mountain predominantly inhabited by Syrian Turkmens located in the northwestern Latakia province. According to Syria Turks Association tanks artillery and missiles were used in the attack and explosions were also heard in villages located on the Turkish side of the border. Four wounded were brought to hospitals in Turkeys Hatay province for treatment. The attack is a larger part of the operation as Syrian army announced on Sunday that it had stepped up air strikes and retaken villages in a new offensive on opposition forces in coastal province of Latakia. Aerial bombardment had intensified over the past 48 hours in a bid to cut rebel supply lines in rugged territory close to Turkeys border an army source was quoted as saying on state media. Latakia province - home to Syrias biggest port and a stronghold of President Bashar al Assads Alawite sect - has been a key battleground of the conflict which is now in its fifth year. Sunni Muslim groups including al Qaedas Syrian offshoot the Nusra Front control many villages in the borderlands north of the government-held Mediterranean port city of Latakia and other areas dominated by Alawites who follow an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The army said five villages and hilltops including Beit Khadour Beit Zaifa Tel alKhadar and Jabal al Rahmaliya had been wrested back from the insurgents bringing it closer to the border areas. The army had stepped up its campaign in the province since insurgents took the strategically located town of Jisr al Shughour in April strengthening their position in a mountain range that overlooks Alawite villages and close to Qardaha hometown of the Assad family. The area has been in control of opposition forces since September 2012. The rough terrain and heavy forests has allowed the opposition forces to resist heavy Syrian army shelling and withstand heavy aerial bombing defense analysts say. A Syrian army officer said the aim of the latest operation was to cut rebel supply lines from the Turkish border to the rebel held villages including the town of Salma that has been held by Nusra Front since 2012. 'These armed men are weaker than to try to dare get close to Latakia' a senior army officer was quoted as saying in a report from the area by Lebanese Hezbollahs television al-Manars correspondent. Last year the Syrian army wrested back control of the Christian town border town of Kasab a gateway to Turkey nearer the coast in Latakia after less than three months of control by opposition forces including Nusra Front. The Syrian war has taken on a starkly sectarian character with the overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels backed by Sunni Gulf Arab powers fighting to overthrow Assad who is backed by Shiite Iran.",

(AFP Photo) At least 18 civilians were killed on Tuesday when a ground-to-ground missile struck a rebel-held neighborhood in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo a monitoring group said. Another 50 were wounded or missing in the citys central neighborhood of Maghawir the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said blaming the attack on forces loyal to the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Aleppo Syrias largest city before it was engulfed by fighting in 2012 is divided between the Assad regime-held western districts and the rebel-held east. In the Qalamoun region west of the capital Damascus government forces backed by the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah seized areas outside Zabadani the last rebel-controlled town in the area. The Hezbollah said it had taken control of the plain outside the city and a main road in cooperation with the Syrian army. 'The city of Zabadani is under the full siege of the Syrian army and our resistance fighters' the terrorist group said. Hezbollah is trying to eliminate rebel forces from all areas between the Lebanese border and Damascus. Zabadani lies 12 kilometers from the border crossing on the Damascus-Beirut highway and about 25 kilometers north-west of the Syrian capital. The Syrian conflict which started when the Assad regime forces brutally repressed peaceful protests in 2011 has descended into a multi-sided civil war. Forces loyal to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad are facing off against an array of rebel and terrorist groups and both sides are under attack from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) group which now controls most of eastern Syrian territory. Syrias Kurds have carved out a de facto autonomous region named Rojava in the north of the country and are attacking ISIS with intensive U.S.-led air support.",

    "December 16 2013 Death toll in Syrian bombing raid on Aleppo rises to 76: monitor. Seventy-six people including 28 children were killed on Sunday when Syrian army helicopters dropped barrel bombs on the northern city of Aleppo the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Monday. Barrel bombs are explosive-filled cylinders or oil barrels often rolled out of the back of helicopters with little attempt at striking a particular target but capable of causing widespread casualties and significant damage. The Britain-based Observatory said that rebel groups in Aleppo issued a statement asking civilians in government-held parts of the city to move away from state security buildings which they said would be targeted in retaliation for the bombings. Slideshow (3 Images) President Bashar al-Assads forces battling rebels in a 2-1/2 year conflict that has killed more than 100000 people frequently deploy air power and artillery against rebel-held districts across the country. They have been unable to recapture eastern and central parts of Aleppo which rebels stormed in the summer of 2012 but they have driven rebel fighters back from towns to the southeast of the city in recent weeks. The conflict has grown sectarian with majority Sunni rebels battling Assads own Alawite sect and Shiite militia. The Observatory - which has a network of opposition pro-government and medical sources - also said on Monday that rebels in northern Aleppo province were threatening to strike two Shiite villages they have surrounded with missiles if barrel bombs were used again by the army.

    "August 21 2013 Saudi Arabia calls for emergency U.N. Council meeting on Syria. Saudi Arabia called on Wednesday for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss reports of a chemical attack that opposition groups say killed hundreds of people in Syria. It is time for the Security Council to shoulder its responsibility and overcome differences between its members and restore the confidence of the international community by convening immediately to issue a clear and deterrent resolution that will put an end to this human crisis Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said in a statement. Leading Syrian opposition figure George Sabra said in Turkey the attack in which chemical weapons were used had killed 1300 people. Syria described the reports its army had used chemical weapons as completely untrue. Video footage from districts east of Damascus showed people choking some of them foaming at the mouth and many bodies with no signs of injuries. Prince Saud whose country has been a major supporter of rebels fighting to topple Assad also urged European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels to discuss the Syrian crisis. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... warns that continuing to shy away from responsibility in dealing with the Syrian crisis will lead to more of these tragedies he said. A U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and government forces have used chemical weapons in the past. The Swedish scientist leading the team Ake Sellstrom said the latest reports should be looked into but doing so would require a request from a U.N. member state.

    "August 22 2013 Assads forces bombard Damascus suburbs after gas attack: activists. Syrian President Bashar al-Assads forces bombarded rebel-held suburbs of Damascus on Thursday activists said keeping up pressure on the besieged region a day after the opposition accused the army of gassing hundreds in a chemical weapons attack. Rockets fired from multiple launchers and heavy mortar rounds hit the neighborhoods of Jobar and Zamalka which are on the eastern outskirts of the capital. Between 500 and 1300 people died on Wednesday from chemical weapons attacks in those areas which are part of what is known as the Ghouta the activists said. Rockets also hit the nearby district of Qaboun to the north where rebel fighters have repelled attempts by loyalist forces to overrun the area and the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp area to the south the activists added. Speaking from Ghouta activist Khaled Amer said explosions from rockets hitting Zamalka were being heard. In Jobar a Damascus neighborhood only 3 km (2 miles) from the historic center of the ancient capital explosions were heard at an army fortification and another compound housing tanks apparently from a rebel attack on the facilities. Fadi al-Shami of the Tarhrir al-Sham Brigade which operates in the eastern Ghouta region said scattered fighting was taking place along the Jobar-Zamalka axis and that opposition forces have moved closer to loyalist lines partly to be in safer positions in case of another chemical attack.

    "July 19 2014 Islamic State killed 270 in Syrian gas field battle: monitor. Militant group Islamic State killed 270 soldiers guards and staff when they captured a Syrian gas field on Thursday in the bloodiest clash yet between the al Qaeda offshoot and President Bashar al-Assads forces a monitoring group said on Saturday. The anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Thursday that 90 people had been killed and that many were missing after the attack against the Shaar gas field east of Homs in central Syria. But on Saturday the Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through a network of sources in the country on both sides quoted trusted sources as saying that the Islamic State had killed and executed 270 people during the assault. It said at least 40 Islamic State fighters were killed in the offensive. Islamic State has made rapid gains in Syria mostly by seizing territory from rival rebel groups using weaponry brought in from Iraq where last month it managed to take large areas from government forces. It was not immediately possible to verify the Observatorys report. Syrian state media made no mention of the attack. About 30 people had managed to escape to the nearby Hajjar field the Observatory report added. Activists say the Syrian air force has in recent weeks stepped up attacks on positions held by Islamic State formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. Islamic State fighters have previously taken control of oilfields in Iraq as well as in Syrias eastern Deir al-Zor province. The group was once the Iraqi affiliate of al Qaeda but al Qaeda disowned it in February after tensions mounted over its expansion into Syria. Islamic State has declared a caliphate in the areas where it operates in Iraq and Syria. There the group has imposed Islamic law carrying out harsh penalties including several executions. In Raqqa in eastern Syria two women were stoned to death for adultery the Observatory said. One was killed on Friday and one on Saturday according to the report which could not immediately be corroborated. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syrias conflict which started as a peaceful protest movement in 2011 but descended into a multifaceted civil war after a government crackdown.

    "September 10 2013 France seeks U.N. resolution on Syria chemical arms. France sought to seize the diplomatic initiative on Syria on Tuesday saying it would push for a U.N. resolution setting out terms for the destruction of its chemical weapons and warning of serious consequences if it resisted. The announcement by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius came a day after a surprise proposal by Russia that its Syrian ally hand over its chemical weapons stocks in a move that could avert possible U.S. military strikes. Fabius said the proposed resolution would be under Chapter 7 of the U.N.s charter covering the possible use of military action to restore peace and would require Damascus to reveal without delay the extent of its chemical program and place it under international control for dismantlement. The Russian foreign minister made an offer ... This cannot be used as a maneuver to divert us said Fabius whose country has been a strong backer of action including possible strikes against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assads forces. That is why we have decided to take this initiative. France will put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council in this sense and the procedure starts today. All options remain on the table he added. Western officials have expressed skepticism about the Russian proposal fearing it could simply be a delaying tactic aimed at averting strikes but offering no real prospect of resolving a civil war which sprung from a March 2011 uprising. The draft resolution would include an explicit condemnation of an August 21 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus which the United States says came from Assads forces and killed more than 1400 people. It would also contain a call for those behind the attack to be punished at the International Criminal Court. Fabius said he was looking to schedule visits to China later this week and Russia early next week for talks with the two veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.

    "December 19 2016 Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa. Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

    "September 8 2013 U.S. leaves door open to new U.N. vote on Syria Arshad Mohammed. The United States left the door open on Sunday to seeking a United Nations Security Council resolution that could endorse punishing Syria for a chemical weapons attack last month and indicated Arab countries were seeking a tough response. Speaking to reporters after meeting Arab foreign ministers U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said many were leaning toward supporting a G20 statement - already signed by 12 nations including Saudi Arabia - that called for a strong international response following an August 21 chemical attack in Syria. Washington and Paris say forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad were behind the attack in which more than 1400 are estimated to have been killed and they are considering air strikes to try to deter him from using such weapons again. Kerry told a news conference that Saudi Arabia which has been one of Assads most vocal opponents and diplomats say is one of the main suppliers of arms to the the Syrian rebels supported the strike and they support taking action. French President Francois Hollande increasingly under pressure at home and among European partners to seek a U.N. mandate before any military intervention in Syria suggested on Saturday he could seek a resolution at the Security Council despite previous Russian and Chinese vetoes. French officials say a draft resolution presented jointly by Britain and France at the end of August was not even read by Russia and China let alone discussed. U.N. inspectors are likely to hand in their report later this week as the U.S. Congress debates whether to allow limited strikes on Syria. NO DECISION BY OBAMA On President Hollandes comments with respect to the U.N. the president (Obama) and all of us are listening carefully to all of our friends Kerry said. No decision has been made by the president. After the news conference a U.S. official said Washington was not seeking a Security Council vote at the moment. We have always supported working through the U.N. but have been clear there is not a path forward there and we are not currently considering proposing another vote said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Kerrys meeting with Arab ministers including from Bahrain Egypt Kuwait Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed talks in Lithuania with European foreign ministers who blamed the attack in Syria on Assad but urged waiting for the U.N. inspectors to report before any action. All of us agreed - not one dissenter - that Assads deplorable use of chemical weapons ... crosses an international global red line Kerry said alongside his Qatari counterpart Khaled al-Attiya. A number of countries immediately signed on to the G20 agreement that was reached by now 12 countries on the side of the G20 meeting and they will make their own announcements in the next 24 hours about that. Qatar has strongly backed the Syrian opposition. As for Syria and what Qatar is willing to provide Qatar is currently studying with its friends and the United Nations what it could provide in order to protect the Syrian people Attiya said without elaborating.

    "October 5 2017 Syria fighting worst since Aleppo air strikes deadly: aid agencies. Stephanie Nebehay. Syria is in the throes of its worst fighting since the battle for eastern Aleppo last year with heavy air strikes causing hundreds of civilian casualties aid agencies said on Thursday. Hospitals schools and people fleeing violence have been targeted by direct air strikes that may amount to war crimes the United Nations said without apportioning blame. Russia and a U.S.-led coalition are carrying out separate air strikes in Syria ostensibly aimed at defeating Islamic State militants. September was the deadliest month of 2017 for civilians with daily reports of attacks on residential areas resulting in hundreds of conflict-related deaths and injuries U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator Panos Moumtzis said in a statement. Air strikes killed dozens this week in Raqqa where 8000 people remain trapped and at least 149 people mostly women and children in residential areas of rebel-dominated Idlib province in Syrias northwest in the last 12 days of September he said. Explosions in Damascus killed 20 people and civilian casualties were also reported in rural areas around the Syrian capital and in Hama Aleppo and Deir al-Zor Moumtzis said again without saying who was responsible. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that up to 10 hospitals were reported to have been damaged in the past 10 days. We have seen a number of hospitals being targeted we got very worrying reports and converging reports about hospitals schools civilian infrastructure being targeted Robert Mardini ICRC regional director for the Middle East told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office. And of course this is outrageous unacceptable he said adding that damage to Sham hospital in Idlib alone had cut off half a million people from access to health care. The ICRC voiced alarm that violence was occurring in many of the de-escalation areas including Idlib rural Hama and eastern Ghouta. Taken together these are the worst levels of violence since the battle for Aleppo in 2016 it said. Hundreds of civilians killed is certainly a very conservative figure Mardini said. We see a very strong correlation between the escalation and the intensification in the fighting on one hand and the human cost of this conflict the attacks on health facilities and civilian infrastructure. Syrias six-year-old civil war pits President Bashar al-Assads government supported by Russia and Iran against a myriad number of rebel factions some Western-backed and Islamist militant groups. Military jets believed to be Russian killed at least 60 civilians trying to flee heavy fighting in the oil-rich Deir al-Zor province when their small boats were targeted as they sought to cross the Euphrates River opposition activists former residents and a war monitor said late on Wednesday. The U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Syria has carried out air strikes that have also caused civilian casualties which it says it goes to great lengths to avoid. The point here is not to point fingers Mardini said declining to identify suspected perpetrators of deadly strikes. What should be non-negotiable is the respect for the laws of war everywhere in Syria. This is absolutely critical today.

    "August 1 2011 Factbox: Syrias city of Hama site of new assault. Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday tanks shelled a northeastern district of Hama killing four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000. It lies about 210 km (131 miles) north of Damascus.

    "August 24 2014 Hundreds dead as Islamic State seizes Syrian air base: monitor Sylvia Westall. Islamic State militants stormed an air base in northeast Syria on Sunday capturing it from government forces after days of fighting that cost more than 500 lives a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 346 Islamic State fighters were killed and more than 170 members of government forces had died since Tuesday in the fight over Tabqa base making it one of the deadliest confrontations between the two groups since the start of Syrias war. The Observatory which monitors violence in Syria through sources on the ground said fighting raged inside the air base on Sunday. It was the Syrian armys last foothold in an area otherwise controlled by Islamic State which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq. In nearby Raqqa city an Islamic State stronghold there was celebratory gunfire and several mosques announced through their loudspeakers that the base had fallen to the Islamists and cheered God is greatest a witness told Reuters. IS fighters displayed the severed heads of Syrian army soldiers in the city square the witness said adding that Syrian warplanes were heard over Raqqa following the air base attack. Earlier on Sunday the Syrian air force had bombed areas around the base. Syrian state television said that after fierce battles the military was regrouping. Citing a military source it said there was a successful evacuation of the airport and that the army was continuing strikes on terrorist groups in the area which it said had suffered heavy losses. Syrian state media gave no figure for the number of people killed in the clashes. Islamic State had also trapped around 150 retreating Syrian soldiers in an area near the base and was believed to be holding them captive the Observatory said. Residents of Tabqa city tour the streets on motorcycles carrying flags in celebration after Tabqa air base fell to Islamic State militants in nearby Raqqa city August 24 2014. REUTERS/Stringer The Syrian army sent reinforcements to the base overnight on Friday to fight Islamic State which controls roughly a third of northern and eastern Syria. Syrian television had shown footage of army forces defending the base on Saturday who had said it was safe from Islamic States advances. Many of the Islamic State fighters died after Syrian warplanes bombarded the area the Observatory said. MILITARY BASES Slideshow (3 Images) Islamic State a radical offshoot of al Qaeda has taken three Syrian military bases in the area in recent weeks boosted by arms seized in Iraq. Syria is calculating that the IS push to reshape the Middle East will eventually force the West to deal with President Bashar al-Assad as the only way to tackle the threat sources familiar with Syrian government thinking have said. Elsewhere in Syria the group withdrew from northern areas it controlled outside the city of Homs on Sunday and retreated east after coming under attack from rival Islamist fighters the Observatory said. Fighters from the group withdrew from a headquarters north of Homs on the orders of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the Observatory said citing sources in the area. They said IS gave up the territory to Nusra Front al Qaedas official wing in Syria. As well as Nusra Front Western-backed rebels have also been fighting IS in Syria but have regularly been defeated by the group which in June declared an Islamic caliphate in the territory it controls. Activists have accused the Syrian army of avoiding confrontations with IS because it has weakened rival rebel groups also battling Assad.

People inspect the damage at a market in Syria hit by air strikes on June 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air stikes thought to be carried out by Syrian and Russian forces killed at least 17 people including 8 children in a market in the Syrian city of Ashara near the southeast provincial capital Deir al-Zor city on Monday. According to the British-based human rights organisation it is feared the death toll will rise because of the high number of serious injuries. The Syrian regime which has been supported by Russia in aerial strikes across the country since September 2015 began attacking DAESH last week. But the Russian Defence Ministry has denied its warplanes carried out air strikes on the market place. Many civilians who are unable to move in and out of DAESH-held areas face the risk of being killed by constant air strikes. People salvage goods from an aid convoy that was damaged during an air strike in the opposition held area of al-Sakhour district of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) UN says such offensives are successful in making gains on DAESH. They also put millions of people at risk of displacement. The UNS Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said last week that 20000 people have already been displaced as a result of the Kurdish-led offensive in Eastern Aleppos Abu Qalqal and Menbij city sub-districts which are mostly under the control of DAESH. According to Syrian government sources the army captured crossroads to advance to Raqqa in eastern Aleppo and the strategic city Deir al Zour which connects the territory to Iraq.

    "22 Sep 2016 In the heaviest attack in months fighter jets pounded the opposition-held districts of the Syrian city of Aleppo overnight days after a week-long ceasefire brokered by the US and Russia collapsed. Hamza al-Khatib the director of a hospital in the rebel-held east told Reuters the death toll from the strikes was 45. The strikes come after Russia and the Syrian regime rejected a US plea to halt flights burying any hope for the revival of the ceasefire. Opposition officials and rescue workers said incendiary bombs were among the weapons used on the city. 'Its as if the planes are trying to compensate for all the days they didnt drop bombs during the ceasefire' Ammar al-Selmo the head of the Civil Defense rescue service in opposition-held eastern Aleppo told Reuters. A man runs with a stretcher at a damaged site after air strikes on the opposition-held al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo Syria September 21 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) 'It was like there was coordination between the planes and the artillery shelling because the shells were hitting the same locations that the planes hit' he said. The assault by aircraft from the Syrian regime its Russian allies or both made it clear that Moscow and Damascus had rejected a plea by US Secretary of State John Kerry to halt flights so that aid could be delivered and a ceasefire salvaged. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian regime or mention on regime-run media of Thursdays bombardment. 'It was the heaviest air strikes for months inside Aleppo city' said Rami Abdulrahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the conflict from Britain. Homs evacuation Assad has appeared as uncompromising as ever in recent weeks reiterating his goal of taking back the whole country on the day the US-Russian brokered truce took effect. The regimes main focus has been to consolidate its grip over the main cities of western Syria and the coastal region that is the ancestral homeland of Assads Alawite sect. On Thursday around 120 opposition fighters and their families were evacuated from the last opposition-held district of Homs under an agreement with the regime by which they were given safe passage to nearby opposition-held areas. Families carry their luggage into a bus to evacuate the besieged district of Waer in the central Syrian city of Homs after a local agreement reached between opposition forces and Syrian regime military forces September 22 2016.

    "21 Jul 2016 Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed by US-led air strikes as they fled from the front lines of a battle raging in the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of 'clay and adobe' homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing 'a woman with four of her children and an old man' in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

There is no official information about casualties after air strikes by the regime. Local council member Shadi Matar said aid had not yet been distributed 'because of the intensity of the raids.' The strikes came as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (mainly Arab and Kurdish forces) said they had encircled a stronghold of DAESH militants in Manbij northern Syria cutting off a major supply route. On June 1 Daraya received its first shipment of medical aid. 'The last time people were filling the streets waiting for the aid to come in' activist Shadi Matar told AFP from inside Daraya.

Condemning air strikes United States State Department spokesperson Mark Toner slammed the air strikes on Daraya. 'Such attacks are unacceptable in any circumstance but in this case they also hampered the delivery and distribution of badly needed assistance'. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also accused Damascus of 'extraordinary duplicity' over the bombings. Ayrault said he was 'outraged beyond words' declaring the end of the Russian-US brokered 'cessation of hostilities' deal. According to deal the warring sides would stop fighting each other. It does not include DAESH and Al Qaeda-affiliated al Nusra Front. Around 600000 people are living in besieged areas in Syria most surrounded by the regime and another four million in hard-to-reach areas said the UN.

    "26 Jun 2016 Russian and Syrian strikes death toll has risen while SDF fighters make gains in Manbij. Russian military jets are seen at Hmeymim air base in Syria June 18 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) The death toll from Russian and Syrian strikes in the opposition-held city of Al Quriyah has risen to 82 people including 58 civilians the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. 'Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir Ezzor city killed 58 civilians' the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rights group added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH fighters. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the jihadist-held Raqqa province. Government forces were also fighting rebels in northern neighbourhoods of the city in a bid to halt rocket fire on government-held districts. Elsewhere in Syria in Manbij US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) overran a key road junction in the citys south after capturing nearby grain silos overnight. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including Al-Qaeda non-jihadist rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and DAESH. Members of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attend the funeral of eight fellow fighters who died during an assault against the Islamic State (IS) group in the town of Manbij on June 24 2016. (AFP) The Raqa Revolutionaries Brigades - one of the Arab components of the Kurdish-dominated alliance - also said the SDF had seized the silos and pushed into the city. In 2014 DAESH took control of Manbij it was a key transit point for foreign fighters and funds as well as a trafficking hub for oil antiquities and other plundered goods. The SDF launched its offensive to take Manbij on May 31 driving across the Euphrates River from the east with military advice from some 200 US special forces troops. According to the Observatory DAESH has lost 463 fighters in the battle and the SDF has lost at least 89. A two-day freeze on fighting brokered by Moscow and Washington this month expired without renewal.

    "19 Sep 2016 At least 10 people were killed on Sunday when barrel bombs were dropped by regime forces on an opposition-held town in Daraa. Smoke rises after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Deraa Governorate Syria September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A fragile ceasefire between Bashar al Assads regime and Syrian opposition forces that was brokered by the US and Russia last week has ended with no word of a renewed truce on Monday. From the outset the week-long truce was marred by violations. Regime helicopters dropped four barrel bombs on an opposition-held town of Dael in the southern province of Daraa killing 10 people including a child the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported. People move an injured man inside a field hospital after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Daraa Governorate Syria September 18 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Airstrikes were also reported in Aleppo Syrias largest city and former commercial hub. There was no confirmation as to whether or not the Syrian regime or its allied Russian airforce both of which have oversight of Syrian airspace were responsible. The incidents came just a day after US-led coalition forces killed dozens of regime fighters south of Deir al Zor after mistaking them for DAESH terrorists triggering criticism from Moscow. The War In Syria Interview with Alexey Khlebnikov from Russia Direct on US strikes on regime forces - YouTube Russia has backed the Assad regime since the war in Syria began in 2011 while the US has long called on Assad to step down. The superpowers have been targeting DAESH with parallel military campaigns in Syria forcing the terrorist group to retreat from swathes of land it took control of across the country in 2013 and 2014. But the Syrian war has placed Washington and Moscow at loggerheads with Russia seeking to prop up the regime while US-led coalition airstrikes on DAESH aim to pave the way for US-backed groups to take control.

Zakaria Malahifji head of the political office of the Aleppo-based opposition group Fastaqim told Reuters he believed the truce had 'practically failed and has ended.' Malahifji also expressed doubt that UN aid trucks stuck on the Turkish border would reach besieged areas of eastern Aleppo. 'There is no hope. It has been a number of days of procrastination. Every day there is a pretext. There is no hope of aid being delivered currently' he said. Up to 300000 people in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo are running low on vital supplies due to siege by the regime which is yet to give permission to the 20-vehicle convoy waiting in the Turkish city of Gaziantep permission to cross into Syria.

Both sides have laid the blame on each other for ceasefire violations. On Sunday Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov in an emailed statement accused 'terrorists and the opposition' of using the ceasefire to 'boost their forces and prepare for renewed hostilities'.

    "43 killed in Syria army shelling of rebel town Monitor AFP Sunday 3 Jul 2016 Fierce government bombardment of an opposition-controlled Syrian town has killed 43 people among them children and medical staff a monitoring group said Sunday in a new toll. Hours of air strikes and shelling on Saturday struck Jayrud 60 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Damascus according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said two medics were among the dead as well as women and children. One of those killed was Amjad al-Danaf head of Jayruds medical centre. Activists mourned him online and said he was killed in an air raid as he was trying to treat residents wounded in the attacks. The bombardment - the first on Jayrud in at least two years - began after Syrias armed forces said Islamist militants killed a government pilot when he was forced to eject from his plane on Friday. In a statement the military had pledged that the attack on its pilot 'will not go unpunished'. Early Sunday Abdel Rahman said prominent figures in Jayrud had reached an agreement with government officials that rebel fighters would leave the town and hand over the pilots body in exchange for a halt to the shelling. A Facebook page run by Jayrud activists that publishes news about the town said rebels began withdrawing from their bases around the town overnight. Anti-regime factions in Jayrud include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. A truce between the regime and local representatives had kept the town calm for over two years. Dozens of similar agreements have been brokered among the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias complex war. But a broader ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by the United States and Russia in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides. More than 280000 people have been killed and millions have been displaces since Syrias conflict broke out in March 2011.",

Most of the 50 fighters killed in the attacks west of the second city Aleppo were foreigners and the civilians included three children and one woman the Britain-based monitoring group said. The strikes came in addition to separate raids carried out by a US-led coalition including Arab nations that hit the Islamic State jihadist group in north and east Syria. In Washington the Pentagon confirmed eight US strikes against 'seasoned Al-Qaeda veterans' in Aleppo province. 'The United States has also taken action to disrupt the imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests conducted by a network of seasoned Al-Qaeda veterans - sometimes referred to as the Khorasan Group' it said in a statement. The group it added has 'established a safe haven in Syria to develop external attacks construct and test improvised explosive devices and recruit Westerners to conduct operations'. 'These strikes were undertaken only by US assets' the statement added unlike the strikes against IS. The Khorasan Group is believed to refer to an initiative by Al-Qaedas central command in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region to establish a group in Syria of some of its veteran militants to focus on attacks against the West. Its members cooperate with Al-Nusra Front Al-Qaedas Syria affiliate using the groups resources and bases according to experts.

    "Last updated at Feb 092015 BEIRUT At least 15 people were killed and dozens wounded on Monday in government air strikes on an area outside the capital Damascus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. There were no immediate details on the breakdown of those killed in the strikes which are the latest to hit the town of Douma in the rebel stronghold of Eastern Ghouta. At a field clinic in the area an AFP photographer saw a girl in a purple headscarf and another child in a woolly hat crying as doctors treated the wounded among them a young boy. His eyes stared wide in apparent shock from a face streaked with blood and white dust. His arm was bandaged and attached to a rudimentary drip. In the streets outside locals picked through rubble carrying the wounded to the clinic while a civil defence worker trained a hose on a fire set by the strikes. The opposition bastion east of Damascus was still reeling from a massive government aerial assault on Thursday that came after rebels fired more than 120 rockets and mortar rounds into the capital. The rebel barrage killed 10 people in Damascus including a child while the government air strikes and surface-to-surface missiles fired at Eastern Ghouta killed at least 82 people among them 18 children. Eastern Ghouta has been under government siege for nearly two years as the army tries to break the rebel hold over the area. The siege has created medical and food shortages exacerbating dire humanitarian needs created by regular government bombardment of the area. More than 210000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of the countrys conflict in March 2011.",
    "Last updated at Jul 282016 A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.",
    "Last updated at Jun 142016 BEIRUT A Daesh counterattack on Syrian regime forces advancing towards a militant stronghold on Monday left 28 militants dead a monitor said. Dozens of Daesh militants early on Monday attacked government positions south of the town of Tabaqa a Daesh stronghold on the Euphrates River said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said fierce clashes broke out but that regime forces were able to maintain their positions and were still 15 kilometres from the Daesh-held Tabaqa airport. 'Eleven regime fighters and 17 Daesh fighters were killed in the attack' said Abdel Rahman. Earlier this month government fighters backed by Russian air power began pushing north towards Tabaqa held by Daesh since 2014. The town lies some 50 kilometres east of the extremist groups Syrian de facto capital of Raqqa city and recapturing it would sever the supply road from the west. Last week Daesh militants had sent reinforcements of fighters and weapons into Tabaqa in anticipation of a fierce battle to defend the town. Abdel Rahman said a total of 37 government fighters and 101 Daesh militants have been killed since the regime launched its offensive for Tabaqa. The war in Syria which began with the brutal repression of anti-government demonstrations in 2011 has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It has evolved into a brutal complex civil war among the government rebels extremists and Kurds each carving out zones of control.",
    "Last updated at Oct 042017 BEIRUT A Russian air strike killed 38 civilians on Wednesday as they tried to cross the Euphrates River to escape fighting in eastern Syrias Deir Ezzor province a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Britain said nine children were among those killed as they tried to cross the river aboard rafts escaping from areas where Russian-backed regime forces are battling the Daesh terror group. The monitor which earlier gave a toll of 20 in the strikes said the dead included an Iraqi family. Deir Ezzor borders Iraq and civilians have fled into the province to escape the battles against Daesh in their own country. Two campaigns are being fought against Daesh in east Deir Ezzor with one on the western side of the Euphrates river that slices diagonally across the province led by Syrian troops and backed by ally Russia. The second is being fought by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters on the eastern bank of the river. The observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. The group has reported hundreds of civilians killed in operations against Daesh in Deir Ezzor and neighbouring Raqqa province where the SDF is fighting with US support to capture the former extremist bastion Raqqa city. On Tuesday the observatory said a US-led coalition strike in Raqqa killed at least 18 civilians. The coalition says it takes all measures possible to avoid civilian casualties and that it investigates each credible allegation. Last month it acknowledged the deaths of over 700 civilians in its strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014. Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes since its intervened in Syrias war in 2015 and dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. The deaths in Deir Ezzor on Wednesday prompted outrage from the opposition Syrian National Coalition which described the incident as a heinous crime. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.",
    "Last updated at Oct 032017 BEIRUT A US-led coalition air strike killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in the Daesh extremist groups former stronghold of Raqqa the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. International coalition planes targeted water wells where a group of civilians were gathered in the north of Raqqa city killing at least 18 civilians observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based group said four children were among the dead. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters broke into Raqqa in June and has since wrested 90 per cent of the city from Daesh. But activists say coalition strikes in support of the operation have killed hundreds of civilians and caused enormous damage. The coalitions spokesman Colonel Ryan Dillon said it does everything within its power to limit harm to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure. He said rigorous standards were applied to coalition targeting and extraordinary efforts taken to avoid civilian deaths. The coalition conducts a detailed assessment of each and every allegation of possible civilian casualties and we will do so for this allegation as well he added in an e-mail to AFP. In late September the coalition acknowledged the deaths of 735 civilians in its strikes on Syria and Iraq since 2014. But activists say the toll is much higher. Raqqa has faced water shortages for months because of damage to pipelines caused by suspected coalition strikes. Even in the early days of the Raqqa assault residents said they feared being caught in air strikes or shelling when they ventured to wells or the Euphrates River that runs south of the city to draw water.",
    "Last updated at Aug 142016 BEIRUT Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province. In rare good news a 10-year-old girl shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition the observatory and a security source said. Ghina Quwayders leg was shattered when she was shot by a government sniper at a checkpoint in the southwestern town earlier this month while buying medicine for her mother Amnesty International said.",
    "Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on eastern Ghouta the observatory reported on Thursday.",
    "Last updated at Jul 282016 QAMISHLI Syria A massive bomb blast claimed by the Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens on Wednesday in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city of Qamishli. It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.",
    "Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. 'The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege' said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to 'join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries' from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.",
    "Last updated at Jul 152015 A member of the Syrian regime forces runs near destroyed buildings in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakeh on Monday (AFP photo) BEIRUT Thirteen civilians among them seven children were killed in aerial attacks by Syrias government Wednesday on the northern province of Aleppo a monitoring group said. A woman and her three children as well as another child were killed when helicopters dropped a barrel bomb on the village of Taduf said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Taduf which lies in the northeast of Syrias Aleppo province is controlled by the Daesh terror group. In the provinces west eight civilians including three children were killed when regime warplanes struck the village of Daret Izza held by Islamist fighters and other rebels. Regime forces are continuing to kill civilians through aerial attacks with barrel bombs or shells indifferent to the international resolutions on this matter said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said the attacks amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by regime forces on a daily basis. Abdel Rahman told AFP the bombing campaign was an effort by the regime to turn civilians against the opposition factions or against IS with the reasoning that the aerial attacks are a result of the presence of fighters inside their towns and villages. The regime has stepped up air attacks in Aleppo province in recent days killing at least 57 civilians when it dropped container bombs on the Daesh-held town of Al Bab at the weekend. Also Wednesday 22 Daesh fighters were killed when regime warplanes struck a convoy traveling between the provinces of Deir Ezzor in the east and Hasakeh in the northeast. According to the observatory the jihadists were all Syrians from Deir Ezzor."
